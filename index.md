Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio. I specialize in applying data science and machine learning to heavy industries such as process industries, energy and chemicals where dealing with complex and messy sensor data is a challenge. In particular, I have a keen interest in topological and geometrical methods.<br>  
Here you can find some highlights of practical data-driven solutions for real-world challenges in heavy industries, focusing on enhancing efficiency, safety, and sustainability.<br>

### Selected Projects and Publications: 
## Topological Data Analysis of Slug Flow in Offshore Wells
In this project, [TDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis) ([persistent homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_homology)) was used to perform signal analysis on offshore sensors data and condition monitoring of the multiphase flow. The undesired transition from regular to severe slugging flow is identified and classified with machine learning.<br> 
The article was published in [Digital Chemical Engineering, Vol.4, page 100045 (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772508122000357) but there are a few typos in the formulae.<br> 
A corrected version of the article can be found [at this link](/pdf/TDA_for_Slugs_Article_fixed.pdf).

## Hybrid Approaches to Virtual Flow Metering  
Multiphase flow can be simulated and predicted in case sensor data are not available. While this could be done via either physical simulators 
or data-driven machine learning models, hybrid approaches provide a more versatile approach especially when coupled with cloud architectures.<br> 
In progress.

## Gas-Surface Interaction in Materials: Hydrogen dynamics
In my academic days, I have worked at simulating the interaction between gas molecules and material surfaces.
In particular, I worked on the dynamics of hydrogen on [graphene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene) and graphite surfaces.<br>
Most of my work on this matter is [summarized in a chapter](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32955-5_7) part of this book.<br> 
Other studies were published on international scientific journals. You can find the whole list at my Google Scholar [page](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=l9E9Zs4AAAAJ&hl=en).

## Condition Monitoring of Wind Turbine Data
Several data science methods are used to predict failures in wind turbines for energy generation.<br>
In progress.
